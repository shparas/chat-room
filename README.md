These are stuff I did on my own when I was learning web development in high school - a website where a person could connect with another across the globe based on their common interests, music, etc. and a website where people could create a group without signing in or any other complicated process and could communicate and share files in that group.

Back then, I had no software development knowledge and I didn't know how to structure large projects. These projects are a complete mess but I still keep them because I had spent many (MANY) days and nights working on them and they are still my inspiration; they remind me of my dedication towards achieving something.
